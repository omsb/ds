          Transforming OMSB over a 10-year period requires a phased approach to manage scope, prioritize investments,
          and steadily build on successes. This strategy will be executed in three major phases from 2026 through 2036,
          with each phase focusing on specific goals and deliverables. Importantly, the roadmap includes early
          <strong>“quick wins”</strong> to build momentum and allocates time for change management and course corrections.

                        <p class="text-gray-700">OMSB will prioritize launching a few high-impact e-services within the first year. For example, by **mid-2026**, develop and roll out an **Online Residency/Fellowship Application system** and an **Online Exam Registration & Results portal** (if these are not already fully online). These services target large user groups and will demonstrate tangible improvements – e.g. applicants can apply and pay fees online and receive instant confirmations, and exam results can be accessed online without delay. Additionally, OMSB will publish a **complete Service Catalog on its website and the government unified portal by end of 2026**, clearly listing all OMSB services and their digital availability. These quick wins are intended to show early benefits, get users engaged with new digital channels, and set the tone for the broader transformation.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Early in Phase 1, OMSB will tackle the known compliance gaps identified in evaluations. By **end of 2026**, OMSB will **integrate with the National Digital Identity & Beneficiary Data platform** (so that OMSB services can auto-verify user identities and fetch basic data). The IT department will prepare an **annual ICT audit plan for 2026**, conduct at least one internal audit of digital services, and develop a comprehensive **Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery Plan** for critical systems. Policies like the **Accessibility Policy and Internet Use Policy** will be formally adopted and disseminated to all staff in 2026. Also, a project to revamp OMSB’s public website/portal will commence in 2026, aiming to improve usability and compliance with design/accessibility standards – with a **new website launched by early 2027**. Achieving these compliance and usability “quick fixes” by 2026 builds a strong foundation (and is likely to boost OMSB’s score in the next government digital excellence evaluation).</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Phase 1 will initiate the integration of OMSB’s currently siloed systems into a more cohesive platform. If the MASAR unified platform is still in prototype stage at the start of 2026, resources will be dedicated to develop it into a production-ready, scalable system. Legacy systems (the LMS, e-portfolio, CPD, exam engine, etc.) will begin to be linked or consolidated. **Single Sign-On (SSO) will be implemented across all OMSB digital properties by 2027**, likely leveraging the national digital ID for authentication. An integration layer (such as an enterprise service bus or API gateway) will be established to enable data flow between systems. Key integration milestones include linking the exam management system with the trainee database (so exam results auto-update into trainee records), linking the CPD tracking system with the main profile system (so earned CPD credits reflect on a doctor’s account), and integrating user login with the government’s Tam/PKI single sign-on service. By the end of Phase 1, the aim is that a core set of systems are talking to each other in real-time and users experience a more unified system (e.g. one login, consolidated data).</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">OMSB will build out the backbone for data analytics in this phase. In 2026, work begins on a **cloud-based Data Warehouse**, starting with consolidated data for trainees and exams. By **2027**, the Data Warehouse will be expanded to include accreditation and CPD data, creating a cross-functional repository. In parallel, the schema for the **Master Professional Index (MPI) will be designed in 2026**, and efforts to clean and unify person records across systems will start. The goal is to have a working MPI that covers all current residents and recent alumni by **end of 2027**. Another deliverable is a **basic analytics dashboard by 2027**, providing management with at least a set of standard reports (counts of active residents, exam pass rates, etc.) drawn from the new data warehouse. This will be the stepping stone for more advanced analytics in Phase 2.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">During Phase 1, OMSB will identify the top-priority services (likely 5–10 processes) for Business Process Reengineering (BPR) and automation. By **end of 2026, at least 3 major services should go through BPR** (for example - the resident application & selection process, specialty exam scheduling and results issuance, and program accreditation approval process). These reengineered processes will then be digitized, with new workflow systems or modules launched by 2026 for those services. The effort continues into 2027–28 with more services. A target is set to have at least **50% of OMSB’s services fully automated (end-to-end online) by 2028**. Alongside automation, monitoring capabilities will be built – e.g. dashboards to track service SLAs and identify bottlenecks. Achieving this 50% automation by 2028 would be a significant milestone indicating the transformation is well underway.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">By the **end of 2026**, any remaining on-premises systems will be **migrated to the Oman Government Cloud** or a hybrid cloud setup, ensuring compliance with the national cloud-first policy and improving scalability. OMSB will strengthen its internal network and connectivity to guarantee reliable, high-speed access to cloud services (important for staff and users accessing systems). Key security enhancements in Phase 1 include implementing **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users by 2026**, deploying a **Security Incident & Event Management (SIEM) system by 2027** for proactive log monitoring, and conducting at least one organization-wide phishing simulation by 2026 to raise cyber awareness. Backup systems will be reviewed and tested to ensure data can be recovered. OMSB aims to achieve at least **50% implementation of ISO 27001 controls by 2028**, laying the groundwork for eventual certification in Phase 2.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">The human aspect kicks off immediately. In 2026, OMSB will hold **organization-wide orientation sessions** on the new digital strategy to build buy-in and enthusiasm among staff. By **2027, all relevant staff should complete at least one digital skills training course** (for many, this could be an ICDL-type basic certification; for project leads, perhaps agile or project management training). A **“change champions” network will be established in 2026**, with representatives from each department; this group will meet quarterly to surface issues and share feedback from the front lines. In **2027**, OMSB plans to launch an **innovation suggestion scheme** (e.g. an online idea box or periodic innovation challenge) to start capturing grassroots ideas for improvement as staff become more familiar with new systems. By 2028, change management should be visibly paying off in terms of smoother rollouts and engaged users.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">OMSB expects to see tangible improvements by the end of Phase 1. For example, the uptake of online services (vs. traditional in-person) might rise from a very low base to around **30% by 2026** due to the new e-services. Internal efficiency metrics should show gains – e.g. if publishing exam results used to take 3 weeks, it might drop to 2 weeks on average after the new systems. These early wins will be measured and communicated to maintain support. OMSB is likely to undergo a government digital excellence evaluation around 2026 or 2027; the aim is to **improve its score from 76 up towards ~85** in that next assessment by virtue of the quick compliance fixes and initial service improvements implemented. The Phase 1 Steering Committee reviews will monitor all projects closely, intervening to address any delays (e.g. reallocating budget or resources as needed) to keep the program on track.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">In Phase 2, OMSB will scale up and institutionalize the advanced technologies introduced in pilot form earlier. By **2029, predictive analytics models** (developed in Phase 1) will be fully implemented and integrated into planning processes – for example, generating an annual workforce projection report for the Ministry of Health using the predictive model (to inform how many specialists in each field will be needed). AI-driven solutions will become mainstream - by **2029, an AI chatbot will be live on the OMSB portal** to answer FAQs and guide users through applications at any time. By **2030, OMSB plans to introduce a blockchain-based credential verification system** for board certifications. The **AR/VR simulation integration will also be expanded** - by 2029, data from simulation training (e.g. performance scores in virtual scenarios) will automatically feed into each resident’s e-portfolio, giving a more comprehensive performance record. OMSB will continue to pilot any promising emerging tech. The overarching goal here is to embed **“smart” technologies** into daily operations, aligning with national directives for AI adoption, and to meet the “smart government” excellence criteria.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">By **2029**, the aim is that **100% of OMSB services are fully digital**. The focus shifts from initial launch to optimization. OMSB will use analytics and user feedback to identify any remaining pain points and improve them. More **self-service capabilities will be added - by 2030**, users should be able to perform tasks like updating their contact information, downloading letters/certificates, or checking application status without OMSB staff intervention. Wherever possible, processes will be refined to approach **instant or same-day turnaround times by 2030** for straightforward requests. Another enhancement is **personalization of services - by 2028**, the portal and applications will provide personalized content (e.g. a trainee logging in sees a custom dashboard with their upcoming exams, progress, and relevant alerts). By 2031, OMSB intends that nearly all routine transactions happen almost instantly online.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Having achieved integration with key Omani national systems in Phase 1, Phase 2 will broaden OMSB’s integration efforts regionally and internationally. By **2030, OMSB will establish digital links with relevant regional and global bodies** – for instance, the Arab Board of Medical Specializations, GCC medical councils, or other international accreditation/certification databases. Domestically, OMSB will keep up with any new national platforms that emerge. By **2031**, OMSB envisions participating in global initiatives like an international digital credentials registry or benchmarking network. Additionally, OMSB may consider offering its **MASAR platform or services to other institutions** if it proves highly successful (a potential revenue stream). By the end of Phase 2, OMSB will be digitally well-integrated within Oman and increasingly connected beyond its borders.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Phase 2 is when OMSB aims to formalize its excellence through certifications and awards. By **2029, OMSB targets obtaining ISO 27001 certification** for information security (possibly even ISO 27701 for privacy) and potentially ISO 20000 for IT service management. OMSB will also likely pursue recognition in **Oman’s Digital Transformation Excellence awards** or similar national accolades by **2030**. The intent is to have OMSB be recognized as a top-tier digital entity in Oman’s public sector by around 2031. All internal IT policies and procedures will be at a mature state – continuously updated and fully enforced.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">With most new systems in place by Phase 2, the focus shifts to ensuring the workforce fully leverages these tools and the culture solidifies. By **2029, OMSB expects that all staff have significantly improved their digital literacy**; advanced training programs might be introduced for select staff. New hires into OMSB by this time will have digital competencies as a standard requirement. OMSB may rotate or create **new roles (for example, a Chief Data Officer or Chief Digital Officer position by early 2030s)** to institutionalize digital leadership. An annual **“OMSB Digital Innovation Day” could be instituted by 2031**. The key outcome by 2032 is an OMSB workforce that is confident and competent in using digital solutions, and a culture that actively seeks better ways of doing things rather than sticking to legacy practices.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Throughout Phase 2, OMSB will rigorously measure and communicate the impact of its digital initiatives. By **2030**, many of the headline targets should be reached - e.g. **≥90% user satisfaction** across services, **100% of services online**, significant reductions in process cycle times (**50-60%**) achieved. Cost savings or cost avoidance realized from digital solutions will be quantified by finance. By **2032**, OMSB should be meeting the “Actual Impact” perspective targets of the national framework – showing tangible improvements in service outcomes and stakeholder value due to digital transformation.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">Building on the analytics capabilities from Phase 2, OMSB will advance towards **prescriptive analytics** – systems that not only predict future trends but also recommend actions. For instance, if predictive models in **2033** forecast a shortage of a certain specialty by 2036, the system could automatically suggest increasing training slots or recruiting incentives for that specialty. OMSB will also utilize analytics for **global benchmarking** - by 2033, the board will compare its training outcomes with international benchmarks regularly to identify areas for improvement. The idea is that by 2036, OMSB leverages the most advanced data tools available to continuously refine its programs and operations, essentially becoming a learning, **self-optimizing organization**.</p>

OMSB will maintain an agile approach to new tech, with mechanisms in place to scan for and pilot relevant innovations quickly. Examples of ideas by this phase - **integrating virtual patients or AI-driven simulations into high-stakes exams**, using blockchain beyond credentials, or adopting micro-learning platforms driven by AI. OMSB will also ensure its technical architecture can **scale** – by now it should handle a much larger user base and data volume than in 2026. If needed, Phase 3 might involve infrastructure upgrades to support, say, double or triple the users.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">OMSB will undertake a **strategic refresh in the early 2030s**. Around **2033, OMSB will begin formulating its next long-term strategy (beyond 2036)**, informed by the outcomes of this transformation and the direction of Oman Vision 2040. All the policies introduced during 2026–2031 will be reviewed and updated for relevance. Importantly, **budgeting and funding processes will be adjusted to institutionalize continuous digital improvement** – instead of one-off project budgets, OMSB’s normal budgeting will include a steady allocation for ongoing enhancements and innovation. If any revenue-generating services (like MASAR for other entities) have been developed, those will be formalized to ensure financial sustainability going forward.</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">By **2036**, a core outcome is that OMSB’s internal capacity – its people and structures – are fully capable of sustaining digital excellence without external push. OMSB may formally designate **new leadership roles such as a Chief Digital Officer (CDO) or Chief Data Officer** to continue driving innovation. OMSB can even shift from being a learner to a **mentor for other institutions** - having achieved this level of maturity, OMSB could share its experience with other boards in Oman or the region. By the end of Phase 3, OMSB intends to fully embody the ideals of **Oman Vision 2040** – being a smart institution enabling high-quality healthcare education and services, and helping Oman lead in the regional healthcare sector.</p>

All core processes will be highly efficient and evidence-based. Stakeholders will routinely use OMSB’s digital channels as the primary means of interaction, with high satisfaction and trust. OMSB will be an organization where data drives decisions at every level and innovation is continuous. In terms of national impact, OMSB’s success will directly contribute to Oman’s health and education objectives – for example, ensuring a steady pipeline of well-trained specialists for the health system, and enabling more seamless government services through integration. By **2040**, thanks to this strategy, OMSB should stand as a **model institution** in the country.</p>
