          OMSB will maintain a <strong>Program Risk Register</strong>, regularly tracking and rating these risks. By treating risk management as an integral, ongoing process, OMSB ensures resilience and minimizes surprises, confirming that the benefits of the transformation outweigh the potential risks.

        A comprehensive strategy of this scale inevitably comes with various risks. OMSB has identified key risk areas and developed mitigation plans to address them. By anticipating these risks, OMSB can take proactive steps to prevent issues or minimize their impact. Below are some of the major categories of risks and the corresponding mitigation strategies:

          Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Risks
        </h4>
        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <span class="risk-text">Risk -</span> The increased digitization and data integration raise the stakes for cybersecurity – risks include data breaches (e.g. leakage of trainee records, exam content), ransomware attacks, or unauthorized access to sensitive information. A serious breach could compromise trainee privacy or exam integrity and damage OMSB’s reputation. 
          <span class="mitigation-text block mt-2">Mitigation -</span> Implementing the robust security measures described earlier is the primary defense - an ISO 27001-aligned ISMS with regular risk assessments, strict access controls (unique IDs, MFA) to limit who can see what data, encryption of all sensitive data, continuous network monitoring via a SOC, and periodic security audits. OMSB will also train all users on cybersecurity hygiene to counter social engineering (phishing, etc.). Incident response plans are prepared so that if a breach occurs, OMSB can respond swiftly (isolate affected systems, notify relevant parties, recover from backups). Additionally, critical assets like exam question banks will have extra safeguards (stored offline or in highly secure vaults except when in use, with strict role-based access). Engaging with national cyber authorities (OCERT/NCSC) provides access to threat intelligence and support in case of advanced threats. Finally, OMSB may consider cyber insurance as a financial mitigation for residual risk. The goal is to reduce the likelihood of incidents and ensure resilience if one occurs (quick recovery, minimal damage).

          Project Delays and Budget Overruns
        </h4>
        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <span class="risk-text">Risk -</span> The roadmap is ambitious with many projects; there is a risk that some projects may face delays due to unforeseen technical challenges, procurement issues, or dependency on external parties. Similarly, costs could overrun initial estimates, especially if scope creeps or if market prices for solutions rise. 
          <span class="mitigation-text block mt-2">Mitigation -</span> Strong project governance and planning will mitigate this. Each initiative will have a clear project plan with timelines, and the Steering Committee will monitor progress closely, addressing issues early. OMSB will employ agile project management for software development efforts to deliver in increments and get feedback early, rather than big-bang deliveries that might go awry. Building some buffer time and contingency budget into plans is prudent. Vendor selection will emphasize those with a track record of on-time delivery, and contracts will include penalty clauses for major delays to incentivize performance. If a project is critical and delayed, OMSB can reallocate resources from less critical tasks or bring in additional expertise (e.g. hire consultants temporarily to solve a specific hurdle). The phase-wise approach also helps - it allows OMSB to adjust the pace – e.g. if Phase 1 takes longer for some components, the Steering Committee can decide to defer a lower-priority feature to Phase 2 to ensure high-priority items complete. Frequent status reporting and an integrated program management office (PMO) will keep things on track. Additionally, risk registers at the project level will identify specific risks (e.g. “supplier X might delay module Y”) with mitigation plans like finding alternative suppliers or parallel development.

          Change Resistance and Adoption Risks
        </h4>
        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <span class="risk-text">Risk -</span> Staff or stakeholders may resist adopting new systems and processes – preferring old familiar ways, or fearing job changes. If users do not use the new digital services as intended, the benefits (like efficiency gains or data quality) won’t materialize. For example, if program directors continue doing things offline out of habit, the new accreditation system’s value diminishes. 
          <span class="mitigation-text block mt-2">Mitigation -</span> This is addressed through the comprehensive change management plan outlined earlier - extensive training, involvement of staff in design, strong communication about the benefits, and support via change champions. OMSB leadership will actively endorse the changes, demonstrating their commitment (leading by example, e.g. only accepting reports via the new system, not via old spreadsheets). In some cases, OMSB may need to enforce certain changes after adequate transition time – for instance, setting a policy that after a certain date, only digital submissions will be accepted (no paper) for a given process, which pushes stragglers to comply. Monitoring usage is key - OMSB will track login rates, transactions in new systems, etc. If adoption is low in an area, targeted interventions (like refresher training or even personal visits by the project team to departments to assist) will be done. The aim is to convert as many people as possible into willing adopters, but also to identify and address legitimate issues (maybe a feature missing that is causing workarounds). Recognizing and rewarding those who embrace the changes can also help sway peers. Ultimately, when people see that the new tools actually make their work easier (which quick-win successes will demonstrate), resistance tends to diminish.

        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <span class="risk-text">Risk -</span> Dependence on external vendors for software or services can introduce risks – a vendor might underperform, go out of business, or their product might not meet expectations. There’s also a vendor lock-in risk if proprietary systems make it hard to switch later. 
          <span class="mitigation-text block mt-2">Mitigation -</span> OMSB will perform due diligence in vendor selection, preferring reputable vendors with local presence or strong support. Contracts will include clear deliverables, SLAs, and penalties for non-performance. To avoid lock-in, OMSB will favor solutions that adhere to open standards and allow data export. For custom development, OMSB will ensure it owns the intellectual property or has access to source code escrow. A vendor management framework will be put in place, maintaining a vendor risk register that tracks vendor performance, any issues, and contingency plans. Mitigation actions include diversifying vendors (not putting all systems under one vendor), maintaining an active secondary vendor for critical services (like having two cloud providers, as planned, or multiple support contractors such that if one fails another can step in). In case a vendor is faltering, the Steering Committee will be ready with “Plan B” – e.g. bringing the project in-house if feasible, or switching to a different provider (hence the emphasis on standards to ease migration). Regular Quarterly Business Reviews with each key vendor will keep track of performance and allow addressing issues early. By proactively managing vendor relationships, OMSB can reduce surprises. The strategy also calls for building internal capacity (training staff, knowledge transfer) so that OMSB is not entirely helpless if a vendor drops out – internal IT could keep things running in interim.

          Data Quality and Migration Risks
        </h4>
        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <span class="risk-text">Risk -</span> When consolidating and migrating data from legacy systems to the new data platform, there’s a risk of data loss, corruption, or persistent inconsistencies. Poor data quality could hamper analytics and even operations (e.g. duplicates or wrong records could lead to incorrect decisions or user frustration). 
          <span class="mitigation-text block mt-2">Mitigation -</span> OMSB will approach data migration carefully. It will establish a data migration team and plan early in Phase 1, and possibly use automated ETL tools to extract, transform, and load data from old systems to new, with thorough validation at each step. A period of parallel run might be used for critical data to ensure the new system’s data is reliable. The Master Professional Index creation is key to resolving duplicates/inconsistencies – the Data Governance Committee will set rules for how to match and merge records and what to do with conflicts. OMSB will also leverage external references where possible (e.g. use national ID as a key to help match persons across systems). Data quality metrics (like % of records with complete info, or duplicate rate) will be tracked, with the goal of continual improvement (e.g. reduce missing data fields to &lt;5%). Training staff on the importance of data integrity and how to maintain it in new systems (like proper data entry protocols) is part of mitigation. Finally, multiple backups of legacy data will be kept until we’re fully confident in the new databases, so nothing is irretrievably lost. If a particular dataset proves problematic (say, accreditation data has many issues), OMSB may consider a phased or manual clean-up – dedicating effort outside of routine operations to fix it (maybe hiring temp data clerks or using scripts to cleanse obvious errors).

        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <span class="risk-text">Risk -</span> Some aspects of the plan require cooperation from other entities (e.g. integration with MOH’s EHR, or getting data from the national ID hub). There’s a risk that these external bodies may have delays, changing priorities, or technical barriers which could impede integration. 
          <span class="mitigation-text block mt-2">Mitigation -</span> OMSB will proactively engage these stakeholders early and maintain open communication lines. Through official channels (e.g. MTCIT’s integration initiatives), OMSB will align its timelines with national projects. If one integration lags, OMSB will keep the functionality ready on its side and perhaps find interim solutions (like a semi-automated data exchange) until the other party is ready. Having representation of MOH and other key partners in steering committees or working groups (if possible) can ensure alignment. In worst case, if an expected integration doesn’t materialize (e.g. national portal integration delayed by government), OMSB will adapt – maybe offering the service directly through its portal as a workaround, and connecting later. Flexibility and maintaining good relationships help minimize this risk.

        <p class="text-sm-faithful leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          <span class="risk-text">Risk -</span> Over 10 years, funding availability might fluctuate. Economic conditions or changing government priorities could result in budget cuts or constraints that risk underfunding the transformation. Also, if the self-financing aspects (like MASAR revenue generation) don’t pan out, OMSB might face a gap in sustaining the systems. 
          <span class="mitigation-text block mt-2">Mitigation -</span> OMSB’s financial plan involves securing commitment for the multi-year investment upfront as much as possible (via the Digital Transformation Program funding). It will also actively demonstrate ROI and value to justify continued funding (e.g. through the performance metrics and annual reports highlighting cost savings and service improvements, strengthening the case to stakeholders and budget authorities). The strategy’s phasing allows for adjustment - if a severe budget shortfall occurs, OMSB can reschedule or scale down certain initiatives (focusing on critical ones first). To create alternative funding streams, OMSB will pursue the self-financing model for MASAR – e.g. by 2031, if MASAR can be offered to other institutions, that revenue can subsidize its operating costs. OMSB might also seek grants or public-private partnerships for specific components (for instance, partnering with a technology company to sponsor an innovation lab or co-develop a solution). Additionally, by designing cost-efficient architecture (using cloud to optimize costs, decommissioning legacy systems to save maintenance fees), OMSB will try to “do more with less.” A rolling 3-year investment plan updated annually will allow OMSB to align projects with expected budget and adjust early if needed. Essentially, prudent financial planning and showcasing the transformation’s benefits will mitigate the risk of funding drying up.

The governance framework will include compliance monitoring; any new law (say Oman passes a personal data protection law akin to GDPR) will be immediately assessed by the Data Governance Committee or legal advisors, and an action plan (maybe new policies or system changes) will be formulated. By having robust governance and security in place, OMSB likely will be well-positioned to comply with new rules (for instance, if privacy law comes, having done PIAs and data classification means we’re ahead of many).

          <span class="mitigation-text block mt-2">Mitigation -</span> The implementation plan includes parallel runs and careful cutover strategies for critical functions. OMSB will avoid “big bang” switches wherever possible; instead, it will run new systems in parallel to old ones for one cycle (e.g. one exam period or one application cycle) to ensure they work correctly before decommissioning the old way. The Business Continuity Plan ensures that if a new digital channel goes down, manual backup procedures can temporarily kick in (so services aren’t halted). For instance, if the online portal has a glitch during a deadline, OMSB might have a backup form or an extension of deadline as a fail-safe. Changeovers will be scheduled at low-impact times (like between application seasons) to minimize disruption. Training staff on new processes before they go live also helps ensure operational continuity (they won’t be learning on the fly during a crunch time). Essentially, cautious implementation with fallback options will mitigate operational risks during transition.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed px-6 text-sm-faithful">
        OMSB will maintain a **Risk Register** for the entire program, with each of these risks rated and tracked. Mitigation actions will be updated regularly, and risk owners (usually part of the PMO or relevant committee) will ensure execution of those actions. By treating risk management as an integral part of the transformation (not a one-time analysis), OMSB will be able to navigate the journey with fewer surprises and greater resilience. In summary, while the transformation carries significant risks, none are insurmountable with careful planning and responsive management – and the benefits of the strategy far outweigh these risks, especially given the robust mitigations in place.
